# create fire spawner

Creates a fire spawner that can used to spawn fire sprites. Fire spawners manage the number of fire simulations running at once. If you are spawning a lot of fire sprites, the spawner will reuse existing fire simulations instead of creating new ones, which improves performance. The number of simultaneous fire simulations is determined by the max sources parameter. update/sputter intervals. If your game needs different types of fire, you should create one fire spawner for each type (e.g. one for lanterns, one for campfires, one for attacks, etc.)

```sig
let mySpawner = fireEffect.createFireSpawner(8, 16, 30)
```

## Parameters

* **width**: The width of the sprites generated by this spawner.
* **height**: The height of sprites generated by this spawner. If this is too low, the fire may be cut off at higher strength values.
* **strength**: The strength of the fire. Higher numbers will result in a brighter, taller fire.
* **maxSources**: The max number of unique fire simulations.
* **roundedBottom**: If true, the fire will have a rounded bottom edge.
